# Basic-Starter
This is just a base for starting new sites using Grunt and Node.

## Let's Get Started
- First, clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/wylie/Basic-Starter.git`
- Next, run: `npm install`
- Finally, to compile the LESS: `grunt compile`
	- If you have LESS to compile then this will create a css file: css/basic-starter.css

**If you want to start a server to see the files in the html directory, do the following**

- In a new command line window, run: `grunt server`
- Finally, navigate to: http://localhost:8000/html/
